# 🔍 YouTube Search Bar Clone

Hey!  
This is a simple clone of the YouTube search bar that I made using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. The main focus was to practice layout, search input styling, and smooth animations.

## ✍️ Why I made this

I wanted to try cloning a real-world UI component and see how close I could get with just HTML/CSS. It helped me understand better how positioning, padding, icons, and transitions work together.
